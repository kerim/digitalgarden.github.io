For years I've struggled with hip pain. Like the story of the blind men and the elephant, doctors tend to see my issues through the lens of their own area of specialization, making it hard to get a good diagnosis. Finally, frustrated as the problem got worse and worse, I [turned to YouTube]<span class="roam-blockref-missing">(VtaJ80Myf</span>) and now, for the first time in decades, I can feel that I'm on the mend.

I'm not a doctor, and my problem may be different from yours, but on these pages I hope to share what I learned about diagnosing, managing, and even treating hip problems.
