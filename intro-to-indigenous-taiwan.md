I often get asked about resources to learn about Indigenous Taiwanese culture and history, especially for people who are just starting off. Although I try to write [my own publications](https://kerim.oxus.net/research.html) with a wide audience in mind (and I cite widely, making the bibliographies a useful resource on their own), I know there is a need for a more basic starting point. On this page I've collected some of those references. 

## General Texts

While I wish there was a nice book length text which served this purpose, right now one of the best places to start is actually [the Wikipedia page on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_indigenous_peoples). Fortunately, it is pretty well put together.

There are then three edited volumes that are excellent starting points:

* Blundell, David, ed. 2009. _Austronesian Taiwan: Linguistics, History, Ethnology, Prehistory_. (2nd edition). Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines.
* Fell, Dafydd, Daniel Davies, and Chia-Yuan Huang. 2021. _Taiwan’s Contemporary Indigenous Peoples_. Routledge. (Available this July)
* Shih, Shu-Mei, and Lin-Chin Tsai, eds. 2021. _Indigenous Knowledge in Taiwan and Beyond_. Springer, Singapore.

And here is a collection of Indigenous Taiwanese literature

* Balcom, John, and Yingtish Balcom. 2005. _Indigenous Writers of Taiwan: An Anthology of Stories, Essays, and Poems_. Columbia University Press.

The syllabus for my course on "[Indigenous Taiwan on Screen](https://kerim.oxus.net/syllabi/indigenous-taiwan-on-screen/)" also contains some useful introductory texts, and a lot of great films as well. 

Also see my section on <span class="roam-page">[[[Taiwan Maps and Guides]]](taiwan-maps-and-guides)</span> where I include Cheryl Robbins guide books for traveling in Indigenous Areas.
