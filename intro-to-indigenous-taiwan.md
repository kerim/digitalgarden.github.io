I often get asked about resources to learn about Indigenous Taiwanese culture and history, especially for people who are just starting off. Although I try to write [my own publications](https://kerim.oxus.net/research.html) with a wide audience in mind, I know there is a need for a more basic starting point. On this page I've collected some of those references.

While I wish there was a nice book length text which served this purpose, right now one of the best places to start is actually [the Wikipedia page on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_indigenous_peoples). Fortunately, it is pretty well put together.

There are then two edited volumes that are essential starting points:

* Blundell, David, ed. 2009. _Austronesian Taiwan: Linguistics, History, Ethnology, Prehistory_. (2nd edition). Shung Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines.
* Fell, Dafydd, Daniel Davies, and Chia-Yuan Huang. 2021. _Taiwan’s Contemporary Indigenous Peoples_. Routledge. (Available this July)

Finally, here is a collection of Indigenous Taiwanese literature

* Balcom, John, and Yingtish Balcom. 2005. _Indigenous Writers of Taiwan: An Anthology of Stories, Essays, and Poems_. Columbia University Press.
