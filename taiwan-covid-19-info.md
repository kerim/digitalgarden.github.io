## Vaccination

> Reservations for people in Taiwan not on priority lists to get a COVID-19 vaccination opened at 10 a.m. Monday, with spots in some hospitals filling up quickly.... The reservation program was launched after the government had trouble convincing those eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine, which could result in many imported vaccine doses going unused before their expiration date.

Be prepared for fairly strong side effects for 36 hours after your first dose, with some lingering fatigue for a few more days after.

Currently (according to someone on Twitter) they seem to be turning away women who are on birth control pills.
