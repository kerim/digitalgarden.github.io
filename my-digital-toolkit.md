While most of my advisors managed to be much more productive than I ever will be just using a manual typewriter and a hand written journal, I have always enjoyed trying out new tools to see what they can do. Below are some notes about my current digital toolkit.

## Writing and Research

Note-taking : [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)

* I have always liked using outliners. I still fondly remember using [MORE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_%28application%29) on my MacPlus in college, so I was happy when I learned about modern web apps that captured this feeling, such as [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) and [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/). But Roam Research added a couple of amazing new twists to this old formula. I [wrote a post about what makes Roam special](https://anthrodendum.org/2020/05/05/roam-if-you-want-to/). 
* Roam is a web app, and currently lacks a native mobile app, although they say they are working on one.
* Some people prefer [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which has some similar features, but is based around plain text documents, not an outliner.  

Writing: [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) 

* While Roam is good for capturing and linking ideas, when I need to start writing I usually open up Ulysses, which offers a clean, distraction-free writing environment with a number of nice features. I especially like the ability to break up larger projects into a number of smaller documents that can be moved around. It also allows you to set writing goals and limits (such as 500 words, or reading-time of 10 minutes). 
* Ulysses is on MacOS and iOS.
* Some people prefer [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview).

Reference management: [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/app)

* Paperpile is excellent at grabbing metadata about books and journal articles from almost any webpage or PDF. When used together with Google Docs or Microsoft Word it also does a great job at formatting in-text citations and bibliographies for publications. I also like to use it for collaboration, since it is easy to share your library with people, even if they don't use the app.
* Paperpile is a web app, but there are also mobile apps for iOS and Android.
* Some people prefer [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), which is free.

## Other Tools 

Presentations: [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/)

* Make presentations out of a single (markdown formatted) plaintext file. Very easy to use.
* MacOS only.

Blogging: [Blot](https://blot.im/)

* Stupidly simple blogging. Just put any file in a dropbox folder and it becomes a blog post! No interface really, you can use whatever text editor you like to edit the files. (It accepts plain text files or Word documents, etc. and you can add images as well.) 

Transcription: [oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/)

* Free app for transcribing audio or video. 
* Works in your browser, but your data stays local, not in "the cloud." Available in many languages.

Collaborative Task Manager: [Todoist](https://todoist.com) 

* There are many online collaborative task managers, but few that offer so many features for free, or which work if only one of the users has paid for a pro membership. Of these, Todoist is currently the best. It also works very well for grabbing websites as tasks via the Chrome extension or the iOS app, making it useful for bookmarking things that need to be checked off.
* Available on every platform.
